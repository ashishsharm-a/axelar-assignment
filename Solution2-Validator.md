# 1. Additional Requirements: Validator vs Node 

## Hardware & System
Higher specs: Validators typically need 6-8 CPU cores, 16-32-GB RAM, and 1-TB+ SSD for high throughput and reliability—versus ~4 cores, 8-GB RAM for a basic node setup 
Tuned system limits: You must raise file descriptor limits (e.g. ulimit -n 16384) and may need specialized OS tuning for consensus stability 

## Operational Responsibilities
On-chain duties: Validators earn stake-based rewards and must participate in consensus and cross-chain signing ceremonies using threshold cryptography 
Multi-chain support (optional but incentivized): They may operate full nodes or light clients for external chains to increase inflationary rewards via supporting the chains 

## Governance & Performance
Governance voting: Active participation across upgrades and proposals via on-chain governance channels 
Performance metrics: Must maintain uptime (>99.8%), regular heartbeats, successful EVM voting, and low slashing risk. Axelar Foundation tracks these via Axelarscan or internal tooling

```

**genesis.json** defines the initial state, chain-id, validators.

**app.toml** & **config.toml** set operational parameters and networking.

**node_key.json** & **priv_validator_key.json** are security-sensitive key files:

**node_key.json**: Tendermint peer identity.

**priv_validator_key.json**: Validator key used to sign consensus votes.

Stateful volume (data/) preserves consensus state, block commitments, and prevents resyncs.

CLI folder: autogenerated binaries include tools like axelard keys, axelard query, axelard start.
